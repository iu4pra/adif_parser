# ADIF parser and QSL generator

Creating an ADIF file parser in Python in order to generate QSL cards using Jinja and HTML templates

An option to generate images rather than multipage PDF files might be added in the future. External utilities *wkhtmltoimage* and *wkhtmltopdf* are used

Work still in very early stage and definitely very user-unfriendly

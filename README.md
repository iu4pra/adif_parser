# ADIF parser and QSL generator

Creating an ADIF file parser in Python in order to generate QSL cards using Jinja and HTML templates. It is possible to output both as multi-page PDF file and images. External utilities *wkhtmltoimage* and *wkhtmltopdf* are used with a very simple wrapper to enable cross-platform functionality

Work still in very early stage and definitely very user-unfriendly

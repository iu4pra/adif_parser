# ADIF parser and QSL generator

This repo is about an ADIF file parser in Python able to generate personalised QSL cards using Jinja and HTML templates. It is possible to output both as multi-page PDF file and images.

External utilities *wkhtmltoimage* and *wkhtmltopdf* are used to generate the final output. A very simple wrapper has been written to allow cross-platform functionality

Command line interface is backed up by a simple GUI written in Tkinter

Work still in very early stage and definitely very user-unfriendly
